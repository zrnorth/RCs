These are my RC files for various things.

I include a basic bashrc because i've had it for years, but nowadays I use oh-my-zsh.
Search in up above to download it ^^. It saves a lot of time setting up console
settings.

I've also included the colorscheme I use for OSX terminals. To use it, open 
iTerm2, hit <Ctrl - i>, and import the file.
