These are my RC files for various things.

I include a basic bashrc because i've had it for years, but nowadays I use oh-my-zsh.
Search in up above to download it ^^. It saves a lot of time setting up console settings.

I've also included the colorscheme I use for OSX terminals. To use it, open 
iTerm2, hit <Ctrl - i>, and import the file.

Don't forget to download fixed powerline fonts. Inconsolata for Powerline
is what I use. https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts/

Setting up a new OSX installation would be as follows:
1. Download and install Iterm2, MacVim, Homebrew, and npm (through homebrew).
2. Download oh-my-zsh and install it: curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
3. Get the various RC files here and put em in the right place (zshrc, vimrc).
4. Using the color scheme file, set up iTerm2 to use the correct colors.
5. Download the powerline fonts for Inconsolata (or whatever font you like.) If you change the font from Inconsolata, make sure to change it in the bottom of the vimrc file.
6. Get vundle using the following command:
    $ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
7. Download any linters you want for Syntastic. Right now just using javascript, JSHint. JSHint is installed using NPM. Put them in the vimrc file.
8. Open vim, and run :PluginInstall to install the various plugins.
